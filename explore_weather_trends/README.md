# Explore-Weather-Trends
Data Analysis Project

In this data analysis project I look at the local and global temperatures to figure out:
 - What is the overrall trend for both local and global temperatures?
 - Are they correlated?
 
In this notebook we will:
 - Work with missing data,
 - Calculate moving averages,
 - Data visualization (line charts, histograms and scatterplots),
 - Statistics functions from the Scipy library.

In the end I discuss my findings and draw some conclusions based on the data.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this project. If there are any questions or suggestions please let me know.
