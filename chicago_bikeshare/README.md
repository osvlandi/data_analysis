Welcome to my Udacity Programming for Data Science capstone project!

### Date created
09/07/2021

### Project Title
Bikeshare Capstone project

### Description
This python script takes as input three data files:
    - chicago.csv
    - new_york_city.csv
    - washington.csv

It will prompt the user for the desired city and timeframe to analize.

It will then perform a basic descriptive analysis as requested.

And it will also ask if the user would like to check the raw data.

If yes it will display 5 rows of the data at each time, until the user quits.

### Handling errors
The program should be able to handle any ValueError resulted from the user input.

It should also be able to quit the application when a KeyboardInterrupt error occurs.


### Files used
bikeshare.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
Credits to Udacity for this excelent course, and to the Stackoverflow community that saves my life everyday.
